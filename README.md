Halom im Nirix creator SSH DDOS a few words about this software
If a person used software and made illegal actions I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PERSON 

Let's get started, to run this utility we need to download python3 (linux version: sudo apt-get install python3 /
Termux version pkg install python3)
if you already have python3 then go to the directory and write the command (python3 ssh_dos.py [host] [port] [user])
host is the ip address of which server or device name,
port - I think everyone knows what ports are, why should I tell you about them?
user is the user this is through whom we will do ddos ​​for example through user or admin,
Usage example
python3 ssh_dos.py localhost 22 admin
