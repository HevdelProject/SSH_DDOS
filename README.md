Halom im Nirix creator SSH DDOS a few words about this software
If a person used software and made illegal actions I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PERSON 


Let's get started, to run this utility, we need to download python3 (Linux version: sudo apt-get install python3 /
Termux version pkg install python3)
if you already have python3 go to directory and write command
(pip install paramiko)
further we write
(python3 ssh_dos.py [host] [port] [user])
host is the IP address of which server or device name,
port - I think everyone knows what ports are, why should I talk about them?
user is the user through whom we will execute ddos, for example, through user or administrator,
Usage example
python3 ssh_dos.py localhost 22 admin
